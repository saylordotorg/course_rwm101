**Unit 2: Order of Operations** <span id="2"></span> 
*In life, we often have procedures that everybody uses to avoid
problems.  When driving a car, for example: if you want to change lanes,
you have to first look to make sure the lane is clear, activate your
turn signal, check the lane again, move into the lane, and deactivate
your turn signal.  You do not move into the lane, activate your signal,
make sure the lane is clear, and deactivate your signal.  That can, and
eventually will, cause a serious accident.  In order to avoid costly
errors, mathematicians had to agree on the series of steps that are
needed to simplify expressions involving the four basic operations,
grouping symbols, and exponents.  This series of steps is known as the
“order of operations” and is more commonly known as either PEMDAS or
“Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally, she Left to Right.”  This tells us in
which order to simplify the expression.  (Tip: it is multiply OR divide
and add OR subtract–* *whichever you see first.)*  
  
 *Mathematicians also needed a way to quickly write out a repeated
multiplication problem, like 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, so they invented the use
of exponents.  This unit will introduce you to the process of working
with basic exponents.  As you go higher, you will learn more about
exponents.*  
  
 *Another topic you will learn about in this unit is the concept of
“greatest common factor.”  Mathematically, the greatest common factor
(GCF) is the largest number you can divide two or more numbers by.  In
real life, it also makes appearances, both mathematical and
non-mathematical.  A detective trying to make connections between an
arrested criminal and a suspected accomplice is going to be less
interested in the facts that they have both eaten at McDonald’s and both
like strawberry milkshakes than in the fact that the suspected
accomplice has been the criminal’s best friend for twenty years.  That
fact is far greater to the investigation.*  
  
 *The last topic you will cover is related to greatest common factor but
is different.  It is known as “least common multiple.”  Here, you are
trying to determine the smallest number that two numbers can both divide
into.  Again, it appears in life.  Let’s say your favorite radio station
is running a promotion: every fifth caller receives free concert
tickets, and every twelfth caller receives a free gas card.  How long
will it take before they have a caller who receives both prizes on the
same phone call?  This is an example of using the least common
multiple.  (In case you are wondering, it would be the 60<sup>th</sup>
caller who won both prizes.)*
