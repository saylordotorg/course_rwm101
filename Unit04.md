title: "RWM101: Foundations of Real World Math"
course_description: "In this course, you will cover some of the most basic math applications, like decimals, percents, and even fractions. You will not only learn the theory behind these topics, but also how to apply these concepts to your life. You will learn some basic mathematical properties, such as the reflexive property, associative property, and others."

**Unit 4: Decimals** <span id="4"></span> 
*Congratulations on surviving fractions!  In this unit, you will turn
your attention to the “fraternal twin” of fractions: decimals.  Yes,
decimals are really just fractions in disguise!  Who knew? For example,
look at (American) money.  A dollar is 100 cents; a quarter is 25 cents,
or in decimal form, $0.25.  The fraction 25/100 reduces to ¼, which is
read as “one-quarter.”  Decimals are fractions, and fractions are
decimals.  It’s all in how you write them.*  
  
 *Decimals are everywhere, just like fractions.  You cannot go shopping
without encountering decimals.  Whether you are adding up totals on your
shopping list, calculating your change, or even just measuring the
length of something, you will use decimals.  If you add up all your
purchases, find that your total comes to $17.31, and you hand the
cashier $20, you need to know how to determine your change to make sure
the cashier gives you back the correct amount of money.  If you are
measuring the length of your wall in order to fit a couch there, you
might find that the wall’s length is in between two lengths, measuring
at, say, 11.5 ft.  You have to know how to deal with decimals to
approximate distances.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn how to add/subtract/multiply/divide
decimals as well as how to convert between fraction and decimal form.*
