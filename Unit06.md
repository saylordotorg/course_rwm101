**Unit 6: Percentages** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this course, you have already studied fractions and decimals.  In
this unit, you will study the other “fraternal twin” of fractions:
percents, which are actually fractions and decimals in disguise. 
(Perhaps we should call them “fraternal triplets.”)  Going back to our
example with decimals: we established that a dollar is 100 cents, a
quarter is 25 cents, and the fraction form would be 25/100, which
reduces to ¼.  A percentage is simply a fraction whose denominator is
100.  Therefore, 25/100 becomes 25%.  Because it is also 0.25, the
percent is a fraction which is a decimal, which in turn is a percent. 
It’s the Circle of Math.  (Cue music from “The Lion King.”)*  
  
 *Percents appear all over the place in life, especially when it comes
to buying products.  If you are considering whether to buy clothes at
one store that has a sale with 65% off or a second store that has a sale
with 50% off and an additional 15% discount off the sale price, you
might be surprised to learn that the two sales are not the same.  For
those who follow the stock market, you might see the news talking about
how your stock has had an increase of 70%.  What does that mean?*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn the rules of percentages and how to apply
them.  You will learn to convert percentages to and from fractions and
decimals.  You will learn about percent increase and decrease, which
comes into play when you are out shopping.  You will also learn (to the
delight of shoppers everywhere) exactly how to calculate sale prices,
restaurant tips, and other similar items.*
