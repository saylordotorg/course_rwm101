**Unit 1: Number Properties** <span id="1"></span> 
*Just as in life, there are certain things in math that make you shrug
and say, “Well, duh.  I knew that; it’s common sense.”  This unit will
discuss some of the basic algebraic properties which you already know,
but may not necessarily know the names of, because they are what some
math teachers refer to as the “common sense” properties.*  
  
 *The really neat thing about these properties is that you can see their
uses in everyday, non-mathematical ways.  For example, if you drive to
work, you “commute.”  Whether you are driving to work from home, or to
home from work, you are making the same trip.  (Ignoring those times you
take a back road because you do not want to spend two hours sitting on
the interstate, of course!)  In math, the commutative property tells us
when we can move numbers around and still get the same answer.  Another
example is the associative property.  The people you hang out with are
also known as your “associates.”  If you are hanging out with two
friends, but one of them is in a different room, you still have the same
group of friends.  The same applies to certain mathematical situations. 
If you are grouping numbers, depending upon the situation, the grouping
is not going to change anything.*
