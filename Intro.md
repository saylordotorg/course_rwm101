Course Syllabus for "RWM101: Foundations of Real World Math"
------------------------------------------------------------

“Why is math important?  Why do I have to learn math?”  These are
typical questions that you have most likely asked at one time or another
in your education.  While you may learn things in math class that you
will not use again, the study of mathematics is still an important one
for human development.  Math is widely-used in daily activities (e.g.
shopping, cooking, etc.) and in most careers (e.g. medicine, teaching,
engineering, construction, business, statistics in psychology, etc.). 
Math is also considered a “universal language.”  One of the fundamental
reasons why you learn math is to help you tackle problems, both
mathematical and non-mathematical, with clear, concise, and logical
steps.  In this course, you will study important fundamental math
concepts. This course begins your journey into the “Real World Math”
series.  These courses are intended not just to help you learn basic
algebra and geometry topics, but also to show you how these topics are
used in everyday life.  In this course, you will cover some of the most
basic math applications, like decimals, percents, and even the dreaded
“f-word”--fractions.  You will not only learn the theory behind these
topics, but also how to apply these concepts to your life.  You will
learn some basic mathematical properties, such as the reflexive
property, associative property, and others.  The best part is that you
most likely already know them, even if you did not know the proper
mathematical names. Let's start with fractions. Have fractions ever been
bothersome to you? Do you think that there is no purpose for them?  In
this course, you will learn that fractions are all around us in the
forms of measurement, ratios, and proportions--and we think you might
change your tune on the subject.  You will see how to solve those
sometimes troubling fraction problems, like the ones that use 1 ? and 3
?, which don't divide as evenly as you'd like. In case you're not yet
familiar with fractions, let's offer a common every day example: a
recipe for making chocolate chip cookies.  You see a recipe that calls
for 2 ? cups of flour, ¾ cup of sugar, and ½ teaspoon of vanilla, and
you need to make 2 ½ the recipe amount.  Each of these measurements
involves fractions.  If you want to make the right amount of cookies,
you have to determine how much you need of each ingredient. This course
will also introduce you to decimals and percentages, which are widely
used in money, finances, and measurement.  Decimals are all around you,
including when you download applications for your smart phone.   Say,
for example, you've just purchased the newest Angry Birds application
for $0.99.  The number 0.99  is a decimal.  If you want to spend no more
than $10.00, then you will have to determine how many other applications
you can download without going over budget.  In this course, you will
learn how to solve complex decimal problems, such as 13.4561 – 21.03 and
301.21 \* 140.31. You will also learn to write ratios and solve
proportions in the course.  You are probably already very familiar with
ratios, even if you're not aware of it.  A recipe that calls for "2
parts milk to 1 part flour," or a speed limit sign that reads "55 miles
per hour," or a newspaper ad listing apples at a cost of $2.99 per
pound -- these are all examples of ratios.  Ratios and proportions are
particularly useful when doing an everyday activity like planning a
party: “If I need two hams for nine guests, how many hams will I need
for thirty guests?”  Learning how to set up and solve problems like this
is a very useful mathematical concept that is applicable to real life
situations. Finally, have you wondered how graph and charts are created
with certain data?  Data can be visually represented in various forms
(bar graphs, circle graphs, etc.) to convey information to a reader. In
this course, you will see data in common forms and will have to
interpret data (for example, reading a chart of the most downloaded
songs from iTunes or interpreting football statistics for your fantasy
league).  The final unit of the course pertains to charts and graphs and
includes the interpretation and creation of various charts and graphs.

requirements can be found below.   
  
 **Course Designer:** Eric Clark  
  
 **Primary** **Resources:** This course is composed of a range of
different free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use
of the following materials:  

-   Salman Khan’s [Khan
    Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) Mathematics Videos
-   College of the Redwoods: Department of Mathematics’ [*Pre-Algebra
    Textbook*](http://mathrev.redwoods.edu/PreAlgText/Prealgebra.pdf)*,*

    Mathematics*](http://cnx.org/content/col10615/latest/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Please pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the
groundwork for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material
presented in the latter units.  Throughout the course, there are
activities assigned from the *Pre-Algebra Textbook* that you will need
to complete.  You will also need to complete:  

-   Subunit 1.4 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 2.3.4 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 2.4.2 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 2.5.2 Assessment

-   The Final Exam

Please note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final
Exam.  However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through the readings, lectures, activities, and assessments
listed above as well as all resources in each unit.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of
approximately **140.5 hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit.  It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories
and determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to complete
each unit and to then set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1
should take approximately 9.75 hours to complete.  Perhaps you can sit
down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 4
hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.2 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Tuesday
night; subunits 1.3 and 1.4 (a total of 2.25 hours) on Wednesday night;
etc.
