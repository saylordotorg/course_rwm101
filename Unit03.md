**Unit 3: Fractions** <span id="3"></span> 
*The very word –* *fractions –* *often chills the bones of math
students.  Working with fractions is easily the most dreaded, most
feared topic in any math class.  However, fractions are actually very
easy to work with, if you learn the rules.  After all, you cannot escape
fractions in life; they are everywhere.*  
  
 *Have you ever eaten a Hershey’s chocolate bar?  It is conveniently
broken up into little pieces, allowing you the option to devour in big
bites or to savor tiny little morsels.  Let’s say you have a Hershey’s
bar sitting on your dining room table.  Your oldest child cheerfully
announces that she has eaten half of the bar, and her younger brother
has eaten a quarter of the bar.  If you know how to work with fractions,
you can quickly calculate how much of the bar is left.*  
  
 *Fractions appear in many other situations such as sale prices,
measurements, money, gardening; the list of applications is virtually
endless.  In this unit, you will learn to work with fractions.  You will
learn how to reduce them, how to add/subtract/multiply/divide them, and
how to apply them to real-world situations.  One suggestion: never show
fear.  Fractions can smell fear.*
