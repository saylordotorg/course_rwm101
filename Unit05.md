**Unit 5: Ratios and Proportions** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will study ratios and proportions.  These are
mathematical concepts you use all the time, probably without even
realizing it.  Have you ever been in line at a donut store, comparing
the number of chocolate donuts to the number of customers?  That’s a
ratio.  Perhaps you are telling your vet how many times a week your dog
drags you outside for an extended walk.  That’s also a ratio.  Have you
ever been driving on a trip, going around 75 mph, and wanted to know how
long it would take to reach your destination, which was only 35 miles
away?  You would find the answer using a proportion.  In sports,
statisticians use proportions to predict an athlete’s production, based
on what they’ve done up to that point.  In this unit, you will learn how
to write ratios, how to set-up and solve proportions, and how to apply
these skills to real-world experiences.*
