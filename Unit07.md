title: "RWM101: Foundations of Real World Math"
course_description: "In this course, you will cover some of the most basic math applications, like decimals, percents, and even fractions. You will not only learn the theory behind these topics, but also how to apply these concepts to your life. You will learn some basic mathematical properties, such as the reflexive property, associative property, and others."

**Unit 7: Graphs and Charts** <span id="7"></span> 
*The list of available graph and chart applications is endless.  You may
have seen applications such as trying to understand voting trends and
demographics for presidential campaigns and elections.  Or, a business
may require graphs and charts to forecast employment growth for a
specific time period.  Or, you may belong to a fantasy football or
baseball team, and you may need to analyze the history of points that
players have against certain teams as well as other statistics.  In
reading a news article that provides a chart, you may want to determine
what information the chart provides.  Using graphs and charts is a way
to convey data that is easy to understand for a specific audience. 
Knowing how to read and interpret these items is of utmost importance in
life, because charts and graphs can be manipulated to misrepresent the
data.*  
  
 *This unit discusses various topics when using graphs and charts in
mathematics.  For each type of graph in the unit, you will need to
create a graph as well as interpret the results of this type of graph. 
You will learn to create charts and graphs (stem-and-leaf plots, line
graphs, bar graphs, box-and-whisker plots, circle or pie graphs, and
pictographs), read charts, and work with the measures of central
tendency for a data set.  (We promise it is not as scary as it sounds!)*
